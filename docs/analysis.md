## Features

__Users and roles__

Me, as a person that uses the system, have a user that performs a role within the system. The app will behave accordingly to my role.

- _The user_

 To get access to the app I want to log in with my user. If I not have a user yet, I want to create a user to myself.

 When creating a user I will inform my personal data, like:
 - first name
 - last name
 - a document number
 - an address
 - an email
 - a phone number

 And to log in into the system, I will set:
 - an unique user name
 - a password

But, I also want an option to create an user based on my social media account like Facebook, Google plus and Twitter.


- _Roles_
